# 🚀 Launchpad

Our launchpad is where emerging project on Stacks are connected with our core community of dedicated $ALEX stakers and yield farmers. That is done through validating IDO tickets which requires both $ALEX or $STX as well as APower, a non-trade and non-transferable token that can only be earned through $ALEX staking or yield farming. Projects that IDO on ALEX can be confident that only our most dedicated long-term holders with a proven track record of staking are able to participate.

If you are a project wishing to applying to our launchpad, please start by clicking [here](https://blocksurvey.io/survey/t/ae87cacb-d736-456d-a3b4-7e404e184ae8/r/l).
