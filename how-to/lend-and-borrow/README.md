# 💰 Lend & Borrow

ALEX is building the fundamentals for the Bitcoin economy. Borrow/lend is vital to maximizing your capital efficiency, by getting the greatest amount of “work” out of your capital.

With lend/borrow we are no longer a zero-sum economy where you either hold one token or another. Now you can use your capital as collateral, borrow against it and pursue other opportunities.

You can avoid the “10K Bitcoin for two pizzas” scenario, as you don’t need to sell or close your positions to access capital you may need short term.
