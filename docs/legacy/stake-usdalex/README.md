# ⚓ Stake $ALEX

## How to Use AutoALEX

The ALEX staking pool now offers two staking options: auto-staking with AutoALEX (atALEX) or manual staking. In this post, we’ll explain the difference.

## What’s the Difference Between “Auto Staking” and “Manual Staking”? <a href="#id-1aad" id="id-1aad"></a>

Both auto-staking and manual staking receive rewards at the end of every cycle (525 Stacks blocks or about 3.5 days).

The difference is Auto-staking is done through atALEX which automatically harvests and re-stakes your rewards, generating passive compound interest. For more information please see “[AutoALEX: The Power of Compound Interest](https://medium.com/alexgobtc/autoalex-the-power-of-compound-interest-eedb2b8535c5).”

With manual staking, to generate compound interest, you must first harvest then re-stake your rewards. We have, however, created an **Auto Stake** function that will re-stake manual rewards into AutoALEX in a single transaction.

## Auto-Staking with AutoALEX <a href="#id-82c0" id="id-82c0"></a>

Mint your $ALEX into atALEX and just hold it in your wallet and it will grow in value, relative to $ALEX, completely passively. The advantages of atALEX are:

* ✅True passive income.
* ✅Greater APY as you never run the risk of missing a rewards cycle or pay regular transaction fees.
* ✅Liquidity with no staking lockup. You can withdraw atALEX in any amount at any time using the $ALEX/atALEX pool.
* ✅Capital efficiency. atALEX can be used as collateral to participate in IDOs or to swap into other tokens and still receive auto compounding gains.

## Manual Staking (Customized Staking) <a href="#id-92b7" id="id-92b7"></a>

Stake your ALEX and manually harvest the reward after every cycle. The $ALEX staked manually will require executing a “harvest” transaction to collect, and there will be a “cool down” cycle with no rewards received, once your custom-selected number of staking cycles end.

**If you have $ALEX staked in manual (customized) staking,**

* ✅The longer you stake, the fewer (cool down) cycles you will have, which produces a greater average APR.
* ✅You must harvest rewards after every cycle, otherwise the rewards will just accumulate with no interest earned.
* ✅**Auto Stake** now allows you to convert your cycle rewards into atALEX in a single transaction.
* ❌ Liquidity: Manually staked $ALEX is locked up until the end of the rewards cycles.
* ❌ Capital Efficiency: Manually staked $ALEX can not be used as collateral.
