# How to Use Manual (Customized) Staking

## Add Stake <a href="#id-347b" id="id-347b"></a>

1. Go to the “Stake” page [here](https://app.alexlab.co/stake)
2. Connect to your Stacks-compatible wallet by clicking the **Connect** button (top right-hand side).
3. Go to the Staking panel section and turn on the “Customize” switch.
4. Enter the amount of $ALEX you wish to stake as well as select the number of staking cycles you’ll lock up your $ALEX for.
5. Selecting the down arrow will show staking details such as:

* Cycle numbers: how many staking cycles you are committing to
* Start block: The block number when your staking cycle begins
* End block: The block number when your staking cycle ends

Please note that during staking your $ALEX is truly locked away and inaccessible until the conclusion of the staking cycle period.

&#x20; 6\. Select **Confirm** in the pop-up window and then confirm the smart contract transaction in your wallet.

&#x20; 7\. After selecting “Confirm” a final time, you should see that your transaction has been broadcast, with a “View in explorer” link to verify your transaction status.

Please note, that it may take up to 20–40 minutes for your balance to update in your wallet and on ALEX. ALEX is built through Stacks smart contracts which settle on the security and finality of Bitcoin, and this transaction time reflects the Bitcoin block speed as well as processing on the Stacks network.

Your updated staking balance should then be visible in the “My Staking” panel.
