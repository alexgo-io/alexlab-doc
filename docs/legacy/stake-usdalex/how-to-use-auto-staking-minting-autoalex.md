# How to Use Auto Staking (Minting AutoALEX)

1.Go to the “Stake” page [here](https://app.alexlab.co/stake)

2\. Connect to your Stacks-compatible wallet by clicking the `Connect` button (top right-hand side).

3\. Go to the Staking panel section and add an auto staking amount:

* Enter the amount of $ALEX you wish to stake.
* The **Auto** section displays the atALEX you will mint for the $ALEX amount you entered.
* The **Current value** represents the “intrinsic value of 1 atALEX” when you mint or the current “minting rate” of $ALEX into atALEX.

4\. Select `Confirm` and then confirm the transaction in your wallet.

5\. Once the Stacks blockchain confirms your staking transaction, you will see your atALEX amount in your wallet and also in the **My Staking** section above with Live APY.\
