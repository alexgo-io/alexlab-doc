# ðŸŒ¾ Farming

Yield Farming on ALEX is an excellent way to earn exciting returns. By farming (staking or locking up your LP tokens), you earn rewards in addition to the earnings from being a liquidity provider. Among these rewards are ALEX tokens, APower tokens, and tokens provided by the project.

To get started with farming, you first deposit two tokens into a liquidity pool, receiving LP tokens in return. Then, you stake these LP tokens in a farm, allowing you to harvest rewards after each farming cycle while still benefiting from the trading fees generated by the pool.

{% hint style="info" %}
**What are LP tokens?** LP tokens represent your share of a liquidity pool as a liquidity provider. These tokens entitle you to a portion of the pool's assets and a share of the fees generated by trades (swaps) in the pool. Learn more on the [Key Concepts](key-concepts.md) page.
