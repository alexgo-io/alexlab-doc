<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Launchpad_06_12.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Oversubscription for IDO</p></figcaption></figure>

#### What is **Oversubscribed Ratio?**

The '**Oversubscribed Ratio'** refers to instances where projects receive funding that surpasses their fundraising target. For instance, if a project aims to raise $100,000 but ends up collecting $250,000, the filled percentage would exceed 100%.

In such scenarios, for every $1 pledged beyond the 100% mark, the amount is divided by the Oversubscribed Ratio, which in this example would be 2.5X. Therefore, if you allocated $100 towards the IDO, only $40 would be utilized for participation, with the remaining $60 being refunded to the community investor.

* **Appx. Funds Committed:** \~355.9 BTC (_Excluding other tokens_)&#x20;
* **Funds Raised:** 11.32 BTC , 400K USDT, 16.5K ALEX

{% hint style="info" %}
**\~355.9 BTC is equivalent to over $33.8 million** committed to the ALEX Launchpad to date, excluding other forms of tokens! (_Assuming each BTC costs $95,000_)
{% endhint %}

A higher rate of oversubscription leads to a more dispersed allocation of tokens, ensuring the distribution is as equitable as possible.&#x20;

Historical data from past launches on the ALEX Launchpad indicate a higher likelihood of projects being oversubscribed rather than undersubscribed, thereby increasing your project's chances for a successful fundraising outcome.

### #2: ALEX DEX Momentum

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/TVL_Dec.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Average ALEX AMM Data for 1D/7D/30D</p></figcaption></figure>

The ALEX DEX is currently experiencing peak momentum, positioning it as the optimal platform for token listings.

When evaluating DEX momentum, we consider it a key indicator for assessing the potential visibility of your token. Higher momentum translates to greater exposure for your token, enhancing its market presence and trading opportunities.

At average, our DEX receives up to:

* \~$7-10M daily trading volume
* \~$30-40M weekly trading volume
* \~$80-110M monthly trading volume&#x20;

_These volumes does not include Bridge volume from XLink._&#x20;

### The Launchpad Process

Now that you have made your mind and decided that the ALEX Launchpad is for your project, here's what to expect to happen:

#### #1: Introduction to the ALEX Team

After you've reviewed all the Launchpad information above and decided to proceed with ALEX, we'll set up a communication channel (e.g., Telegram) for an initial interaction.&#x20;

Here, we'll discuss your needs, get to know you and your project better, and a team member will schedule an introductory meeting or call to delve into your project's details and the launch process.

#### #2: Project Information Submission for Due Diligence

We will ask your team to complete a Blocksurvey form for due diligence purposes. This form will request information such as:

* Project brief & summary
* Team background
* Product information & Use cases
* Revenue Model
* Official Links & Documentation
* Current Development Phase
* Roadmaps
* Estimated IDO valuation

#### #3: Initial Call (Brief Process & Terms)

Once we receive the completed Blocksurvey form, we'll arrange a call to:

* Get to know you and your team better (preferably with video enabled)
* Discuss your current milestones, CEX listing strategies, onboarded partners, product functionality, and IDO terms.

After this call, you'll have a clear understanding of the process, terms of the IDO, and an opportunity to ask any initial questions or seek clarifications.

#### #4: Agreement to the IDO Terms

During or after the call, we'll confirm if you fully agree to the following IDO terms:

* Raise a minimum of $100K.
* Implement a buyback mechanism if the price falls below the IDO price within a week of launch.

By agreeing to these terms, you commit to fulfilling these obligations during and post-IDO.

#### #5: Launchpad Fundraising Documentation Submission

You'll be asked to fill out the IDO Notion Application form, detailing launch specifics, tokenomics, financial projections, marketing strategies, and other operational details.

#### #6: Community Vote

Once the IDO Notion Application is completed, a community vote will be conducted using all provided project information and the fundraising goal.

If the vote results in a majority YES, your project will be listed on the ALEX Launchpad.&#x20;

Users vote with their ALEX or LiALEX tokens, which are non-transferable and earned by participating in Stake and Farm within the ALEX Ecosystem.

#### #8: Launchpad Marketing (Pre, During, and Post)

With the launchpad set up and the countdown initiated, we'll engage in co-marketing efforts as follows:

* **Pre-launch:** We will focus on announcements, teasers, and community engagement to build anticipation. &#x20;
* **During Launch:** Live updates, AMAs (Ask Me Anything sessions), and real-time interactions will keep the community engaged.&#x20;
* **Post-Launch:** We'll provide reports on the success of the IDO, send thank-you messages, and continue with ongoing community updates.

We will collaborate with you to enhance social amplification not only through our channels but also via our network connections, including Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs), ALEX holders, and investors.

If you lack a clear path to Centralized Exchange (CEX) listings, we can assist in establishing these connections.

Our marketing collaboration goes beyond merely listing your project on our website. We will also co-run marketing campaigns designed to maximize visibility and impressions for your IDO round.

During the co-marketing phase, we will host an AMA in the form of 𝕏 Spaces, allowing our 110K followers to participate live or watch the recorded session to gain a better understanding of your project.

#### #9: Launchpad Goes Live!

Once all preparations are complete, the IDO officially commences at the scheduled time. Investors can then participate in the token sale, marking the beginning of your project's fundraising phase on the ALEX Launchpad.

Each step ensures that your project is vetted, prepared, and promoted effectively within the ALEX ecosystem, leading up to a successful token launch.&#x20;

After the launchpad has completed, the unallocated funds will be returned to the investors, while the allocated funds will be converted into the IDO tokens based on the IDO launch price.
